# chingu_website_demo
**General**:\
Before contributing to a Chingu group project, I had to demonstrate a basic level of skills with a solo project. One of the options for a solo project was replicating the general structure of the Conquer website template (https://www.free-css.com/free-css-templates/page196/conquer) using only HTML, CSS, and plain JavaScript. This is that replication. I was not required to make the demo website fully responsive, so in the interest of finishing up the project and moving onto the next, the website is best viewed in a laptop screen size. 

**Notes:**\
Most of the website was coded before I ran into issues trying to add JavaScript features to the nav bar.  The fix I found required a restructure/rewrite of much of the website to get the JS to work. Ok, no worries, can do. And the fix worked...until it didn't. Poking around led to the discovery that *height: 100vh;* was breaking the JS. Que more troubleshooting (which was tricky since I haven't worked much with JavaScript yet). After a couple of hours I contacted the solo project manager about the importance of the JS element, and he said it wasn't important to include. But I'll include the JS code here in case I ever feel the desire to come and troubleshoot more. :D

**What I learned from this project:** \
This was the first major loading single-page website I've coded, so lots of learning about grid, flex, parallax and layers, smooth scroll, and loading files into GitHub.
