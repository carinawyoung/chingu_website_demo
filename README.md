# chingu_website_demo
Before contributing to a Chingu group project, I have to demonstrate a basic level of skills with a solo project. One of the options for a solo project was replicating the general structure of the Conquer website template (https://www.free-css.com/free-css-templates/page196/conquer) using only HTML, CSS, and plain JavaScript. This is that replication. I was not required to make the demo website fully responsive, so in the interest of finishing up the project and moving onto the next, the website is best viewed in a laptop screen size.  

The issues I haven't solved yet are: 
1) There is sometimes a gap between a parallax image and the surrounding website. It's particularly noticeable at the bottom of the website between the last image and the footer. Nothing I've tried so far has gotten rid of it while still keeping the image the same. 

2) I want the fixed navigation menu to show the section the viewer is currently on. I've been trying to modify code found here: https://codepen.io/dbilanoski/pen/LabpzG to work on the website, but because the relevant parts of the website do not have the tag 'section' I'm running into trouble, and am wondering if I need to restructure things to make it work.

3) There is also sometimes a random floater rectangle in the middle of the screen. I'm not sure where it's coming from, or why it only appears sometimes.
